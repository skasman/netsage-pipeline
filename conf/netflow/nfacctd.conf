! Fields we want in the ouput. See pmacct docs for field meanings
!  Note: Not really aggrregating anything since we want timestamp_start/end for 
!    calculating duration and in turn rates. This means we just send the 60 
!    second buckets we get from netflow

! Output timestamps as epoch as opposed to strings we need to parse
timestamps_since_epoch: true

! Gets the sampling rate from flow packet and automatically applies it
!  Example: If sample_rate is 1000 (meaning 1/1000) then it multiplies 
!  packets and bytes by 1000.
